> System Tools for Getting my Things Done and stuff …

This is an incomplete collection of tools that help me get things done.

The dehydrated scripts have been removed in favor of the Ansible role [penguineer.dehydrated_cron](https://galaxy.ansible.com/penguineer/dehydrated_cron).

**Before you use any script or parts of any script, make sure you have read and understood the code!**

PRs are welcome!

If possible, please stick to the following guidelines:

* Keep PRs reasonably small and their scope limited to a feature or module within the code.
* If a large change is planned, it is best to open a feature request issue first, then link subsequent PRs to this
  issue, so that the PRs move the code towards the intended feature.
